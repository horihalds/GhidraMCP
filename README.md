# ghidraMCP
ghidraMCP is an Model Context Protocol server for allowing LLMs to autonomously reverse engineer applications. It exposes numerous tools from core Ghidra functionality to MCP clients.

# Features
MCP Server + Ghidra Plugin

- Decompile and analyze binaries in Ghidra
- Automatically rename methods and data
- List methods, classes, imports, and exports
- Read raw bytes, typed data, strings and pointers at virtual addresses, file offsets, or memory block offsets

# Installation

## Prerequisites
- Install [Ghidra](https://ghidra-sre.org)
- Python3
- MCP [SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk)

## Ghidra
First, download the latest [release](https://github.com/LaurieWired/GhidraMCP/releases) from this repository. This contains the Ghidra plugin and Python MCP client. Then, you can directly import the plugin into Ghidra.

1. Run Ghidra
2. Select `File` -> `Install Extensions`
3. Click the `+` button
4. Select the `GhidraMCP-1-2.zip` (or your chosen version) from the downloaded release
5. Restart Ghidra
6. Make sure the GhidraMCPPlugin is enabled in `File` -> `Configure` -> `Developer`
7. *Optional*: Configure the port in Ghidra with `Edit` -> `Tool Options` -> `GhidraMCP HTTP Server`

## MCP Clients

Theoretically, any MCP client should work with ghidraMCP.  Three examples are given below.

## Example 1: Claude Desktop
To set up Claude Desktop as a Ghidra MCP client, go to `Claude` -> `Settings` -> `Developer` -> `Edit Config` -> `claude_desktop_config.json` and add the following:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "ghidra": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": [
        "/ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py",
        "--ghidra-server",
        "http://127.0.0.1:8080/"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

Alternatively, edit this file directly:
```
/Users/YOUR_USER/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

The server IP and port are configurable and should be set to point to the target Ghidra instance. If not set, both will default to localhost:8080.

## Example 2: Cline
To use GhidraMCP with [Cline](https://cline.bot), this requires manually running the MCP server as well. First run the following command:

```
python bridge_mcp_ghidra.py --transport sse --mcp-host 127.0.0.1 --mcp-port 8081 --ghidra-server http://127.0.0.1:8080/
```

The only *required* argument is the transport. If all other arguments are unspecified, they will default to the above. Once the MCP server is running, open up Cline and select `MCP Servers` at the top.

![Cline select](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88e1f336-4729-46ee-9b81-53271e9c0ce0)

Then select `Remote Servers` and add the following, ensuring that the url matches the MCP host and port:

1. Server Name: GhidraMCP
2. Server URL: `http://127.0.0.1:8081/sse`

## Example 3: 5ire
Another MCP client that supports multiple models on the backend is [5ire](https://github.com/nanbingxyz/5ire). To set up GhidraMCP, open 5ire and go to `Tools` -> `New` and set the following configurations:

1. Tool Key: ghidra
2. Name: GhidraMCP
3. Command: `python /ABSOLUTE_PATH_TO/bridge_mcp_ghidra.py`

# Reading Memory
The bridge exposes four read-only tools (`read_bytes`, `read_data`, `read_string`, `read_pointer`) backed by the matching HTTP endpoints. Every endpoint accepts one of three addressing modes:

- `address` – virtual address, hex (`0x140001000`) or decimal
- `offset` – raw file offset inside the loaded binary
- `block` + `offset` – offset relative to the start of the named memory block

Precedence when several are supplied: `address` > `block`+`offset` > `offset`. Responses are plain text and include the resolved address, so an offset-based request can be mapped back to an address.

## `read_bytes`
Read raw bytes; `length` defaults to `64` (clamped to `1..8192`) and `format` is `hex` (default, 16 bytes per line with an ASCII gutter) or `base64`.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/read_bytes?address=0x140001000&length=32"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/read_bytes?offset=0x400&length=16"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/read_bytes?block=.text&offset=0x10&format=base64"
```

## `read_data`
Read the defined, typed data items starting at the address; `count` defaults to `1` (max `64`). Each line is `<address>: <label> = <value> [<type>, <n> bytes]`; when nothing is defined at the address the containing item is reported.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/read_data?address=0x140020000&count=3"
```

## `read_string`
Decode the C string at the address; `max_length` defaults to `256` (max `4096`) and `encoding` is `auto` (default), `ascii`, `utf8`, `utf16le` or `utf16be`. `auto` honours the data type at the address, detects UTF-16 by interleaved zero bytes, and otherwise falls back to ASCII/UTF-8.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/read_string?address=0x140030000"
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/read_string?address=0x140030000&encoding=utf16le"
```

## `read_pointer`
Read a pointer-sized value, decoded using the program endianness; `size` defaults to the program pointer size (allowed `4` or `8`). `follow=true` additionally reports the typed data at the target, or a 16-byte hex dump when none is defined there.

```bash
curl "http://127.0.0.1:8080/read_pointer?address=0x140021000&follow=true"
```

# Building from Source
1. Copy the following files from your Ghidra directory to this project's `lib/` directory:
- `Ghidra/Features/Base/lib/Base.jar`
- `Ghidra/Features/Decompiler/lib/Decompiler.jar`
- `Ghidra/Framework/Docking/lib/Docking.jar`
- `Ghidra/Framework/Generic/lib/Generic.jar`
- `Ghidra/Framework/Project/lib/Project.jar`
- `Ghidra/Framework/SoftwareModeling/lib/SoftwareModeling.jar`
- `Ghidra/Framework/Utility/lib/Utility.jar`
- `Ghidra/Framework/Gui/lib/Gui.jar`
2. Build with Maven by running:

`mvn clean package assembly:single`

The generated zip file includes the built Ghidra plugin and its resources. These files are required for Ghidra to recognize the new extension.

- lib/GhidraMCP.jar
- extensions.properties
- Module.manifest
